  1 year into the new job. Updating the picture and <a href="https://youtu.be/1x8_3kHM18s?si=P4FkVne0nDV3B6oE">Living My Life</a> I guess. Started listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/zol2MJf6XNE?si=SrETElYER8naL-dI">Animal Collective</a> and like a few of their songs, such as the linked one.

  3 months into a new job.  Traveling next week (for a week) with N and R to North America west coast for the 1st time. Listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Social_Scene">Broken Social Scene</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo_La_Tengo">Yo La Tengo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Avery_(musician)">Daniel Avery</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin">Aphex Twin</a>.  Not finding a lot of time to watch movies, dramas; hoping to find it someday.  Enjoying the spring greenery and other lifeforms in the neighborhood.
