<p>
  I'm a principal engineer at <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>
  on its database server product team where my main focus is contributions
  to open source PostgreSQL. Before joining EDB, I worked at
  <a href="https://www.rd.ntt/e/sic/oss/">NTT Open Source Software Center</a>
  as a senior software engineer with basically the same focus.

<p>
  I was born and got my education in the western state of Maharashtra of India.
  My first job out of college brought me to Tokyo in 2013, where I live with wife
  and daughter.
