  I'm a software developer experienced in open source developement of databases, primarily
  PostgreSQL, and related tools.  I currently work at
  <a href="https://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> on its
  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</a> Data team with a focus on
  upstream contributions to PostgreSQL.  Previously, I worked at
  <a href="https://enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a> and 
  <a href="https://www.rd.ntt/e/sic/oss/">NTT Open Source Software Center</a>.

  I was born and got my education in the western state of Maharashtra of India.
  My first job out of college brought me to Tokyo in 2013, where I live with wife
  and daughter.
