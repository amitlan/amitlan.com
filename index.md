I'm a software engineer with an extensive experience contributing to
PostgreSQL open source project. I currently work for
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/">EDB</a>
and previously spent some 7 years working at
<a href="https://www.sic.ecl.ntt.co.jp/e/oss/">NTT Open Source Software Center</a>.
</p>

<p>
I was born and got my education in the western state of Maharashtra of India.
My first job out of college brought me to Tokyo, Japan, where I live with wife
and daughter.
