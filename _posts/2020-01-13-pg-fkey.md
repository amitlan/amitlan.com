# Postgres: how a foreign key works

June 29, 2020

Foreign key constraints are used to implement [referential integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity)
in a database.  PostgreSQL's [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK)
on foreign keys gives the following example:

> Say you have the product table that we have used several times already:
>
>```
> CREATE TABLE products (
>    product_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
>    name text,
>    price numeric
> );
> ```
> Let's also assume you have a table storing orders of those products. We want to ensure that the orders table only contains orders of products that actually exist. So we define a foreign key constraint in the orders table that references the products table:
> 
>```
> CREATE TABLE orders (
>    order_id integer PRIMARY KEY,
>    product_no integer REFERENCES products (product_no),
>    quantity integer
> );
>```
> Now it is impossible to create orders with product_no entries that do not appear in the products table.
